## Hosts which require special configuration options can be listed in
## host statements.   If no address is specified, the address will be
## allocated dynamically (if possible), but the host-specific information
## will still come from the host declaration.

#
## Fixed IP addresses can also be specified for hosts.   These addresses
## should not also be listed as being available for dynamic assignment.
## Hosts for which fixed IP addresses have been specified can boot using
## BOOTP or DHCP.   Hosts for which no fixed address is specified can only
## be booted with DHCP, unless there is an address range on the subnet
## to which a BOOTP client is connected which has the dynamic-bootp flag
## set.

## You can declare a class of clients and then do address allocation
## based on that.   The example below shows a case where all clients
## in a certain class get addresses on the 10.17.224/24 subnet, and all
## other clients get addresses on the 10.0.29/24 subnet.
